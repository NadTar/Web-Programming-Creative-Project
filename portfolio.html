        <p>
          I participated in reserach group focused on finding ways to support interactional literacy on social media. The linked document is a survey is one I came up with to study
          how people interact with and react to to troll posts on social media whilst educating the user about how these posts cause disinformation. I thought the best way
          to do this would be to have the user interact with the posts as if they were on their own social media feed.

        <p>
          For our final project for the HCDE 300 class, we had to analyze an existing technology from the perspective of archeologists in the year 3000.
          My partner and I chose our existing currency system. Linked is our final report.

        <p>
          A report I wrote from my HCDE 300 class where I unpack the historical and socio-technical elements of modern music notation from a design perspective.
          At the end I provide my own alternate proposal for a new music notation system. I chose to look at music notation because I thought it would interesting
          to analyze a digital technology from an older time. For the assignment we used Benjamin Peter's (a prominent media scholar) definition of digital which is
          anything that counts the symbolic, indexes the real and once combined and coordinated, manipulates the social imaginary.
